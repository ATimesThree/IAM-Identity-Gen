# IAM-Identity-Gen
Made for QLite to create and look up IAM hashes easily and convert from the QLite base-27 to base-10


---------
This project was inspired by the recent QLITE project posted by microhash#4229 (discord).
What you can do with this project;
  - Paste a hash and an index code to create your customized hash (related to the IAM Identity of QLITE)
  - Paste a QLITE base-27 "code", for example AO, and find out which index that is in base-10 numbers (easier to understand for us humans     if we see 42, because then its the 42nd). Td;Lr AO === 42
  

Note that my CSS and HTML skills are very basic as I'm more into JS.
